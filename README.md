# portable-dotfiles

Some dotfiles and a setup script to keep myself from going crazy while working on other people's machines (servers included). This is not meant to be an exhaustive setup script, but rather just the essentials to make myself feel at home.

## Requirements

A Debian-based (or Ubuntu-based) operating system.
