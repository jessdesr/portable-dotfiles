# portable-dotfiles

- These dotfiles and setup scripts are meant to keep myself from being annoyed while working on other people's machines (servers included). 
- These scripts are not meant to be an exhaustive, but only provide the essentials.
- Carefully examine the scripts before executing them to ensure that you only install what you need.

## Requirements

- A Debian-based (or Ubuntu-based) operating system.
