# portable-dotfiles

- Minimal set of public dotfiles
- Use only what you need

- `xmodmap remaps_capslock` will map:
    - Caps Lock -> Esc
    - Esc       -> Nothing
    - Pause     -> Caps Lock
- Use KeyRemap4MacBook, a.k.a. [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), for a similar mapping on OS X
